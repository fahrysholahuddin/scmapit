# todos
Collaborations are welcomed! Do let me know what do you think about this tool or how it can be improved. Just drop me an Email at: vic.kai.liu@gmail.com
Here is my list of todos:

  - Rectangle selection of buildings on the canvas for modification/duplication
  
* Infrastructure wise
  - A layout gallery, maybe?
